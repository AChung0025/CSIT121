                    <p>JPG/JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group<br>
                        JPG/JPEG is commonly used for photographs because it can handle up to 16.7 million colors and is 
                        supported in most browsers and editing software. After editing and saving, you may lose some data 
                        due to lossy compression. This will reduce the quality of the photo.
                        The file extension for a JPG image is .jpg. This photo is of an American Shorthair Calico with green eyes. 
                        I love cats, so I used a picture of my cat here for this example. I have edited this photo many times, 
                        and as you can see, the image has become a bit blurry.
